Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile,<br> train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip. Travel can also<br> include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.</p>

<p>
Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities<br> such as Pompeii and Baiae.While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration,<br> cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind <br>has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which <br>took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.</p></ol>
